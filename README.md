# WAGE

## Introduction

WAGE is a web-based timecard app designed to be equally accessible on desktop and mobile, and developed for and hosted on Firebase. The application, upon completion, will allow the user
 to...

  * Create a User Profile;
  * Log In/Out;
  * Build a portfolio of clients;
  * Assign projects to each client;
  * Log work hours on each project using a simple, intuitive interface;
  * And many more smaller features.

## Additional Features

At the current stage of development (planning), we can anticipate that it would be nice—but not essential!—to include some additional features in the release version of WAGE. Some, but not all, of these features include...

  * Export PDF (or html) invoices directly from the app;
  * Clock-In button "Transforms" into Active Session
  * Invoice scheduling/automation
  * Invoice payment tracking
  * Tax considerations
