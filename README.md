# WAGE

## Introduction

WAGE is a web-based timecard app designed to be equally accessible on desktop and mobile, and developed for and hosted on Firebase. The application, upon completion, will allow the user to...

  * Create a User Profile;
  * Log In/Out;
  * Build a portfolio of clients;
  * Assign projects to each client;
  * Log work hours on each project using a simple, intuitive interface;
  * Export PDF (or html) invoices directly from the app;
  * And more!

## Additional Features

At the current stage of development (planning), we can anticipate that it would be nice—but not essential!—to include some additional features in the release version of WAGE. Some, but not all, of these features include...

  * Drag and Drop interface controls
  * Invoice scheduling/automation
  * Invoice payment tracking
  * Tax considerations
  * Probably many more

## Technical Information

  * Hosted on Firebase
  * Firestore DB
  * Firebase Auth
  * Webpack
  * No JS or CSS frameworks used
  * Google Fonts

## Current TODO List

  * Timer Confirmation Menu (delete? save? edit times? add breaks?)
  * Animations for Timer
  * Remove Unused filters
  * Make timer font-size dynamic
